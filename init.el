;; Place downloaded elisp files in ~/.emacs.d/vendor. You'll then be able

;; For example, if you download yaml-mode.el to ~/.emacs.d/vendor,
;; then you can add the following code to this file:
;;
;; (require 'yaml-mode)
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.yml$" . yaml-mode))

;; Adding this code will make Emacs enter yaml mode whenever you open
;; a .yml file

;; Customization

;; Add a directory to our load path so that when you `load` things
;; below, Emacs knows where to look for the corresponding file.

;; These customizations make it easier for you to navigate files,
;; switch buffers, and choose options from the minibuffer.

;; some user interface elements

;; These customizations make editing a bit nicer.

(load "elisp-editing.el")
